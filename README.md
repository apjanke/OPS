# OPS â€“ the Octave Production Server

The Octave Production Server is the Octave equivalent of the [Matlab Production Server](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab-production-server.html). It allows you to deploy and run Octave code on a server that presents an HTTP/JSON web service interface for calling your Octave code.

## Hypothetical Project

This project does not exist yet! I'm only creating this repo as a placeholder to see if there's any interest in having me (or other people) build this thing. If you would like to see Octave Production Server exist, head on over to [the survey Issue](https://github.com/apjanke/OPS/issues/1) and leave a comment expressing your interest and use cases.

## License

This would be GNU GPL, like Octave itself.

## Author

Nobody has written any actual code yet, but this survey project was set up by [Andrew Janke](https://apjanke.net).

The project home page is [apjanke/OPS on GitHub](https://github.com/apjanke/OPS).
